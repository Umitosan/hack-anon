# _Hack Anon_

## Description

Hack Anon is an online community hub for hackers all backgrounds, whether white-hat black-hat or grey-hat.  This site serves as an anonymous meeting ground to share stories, ideas, and projects relating to technology exploits.  Users are forbidden from using their real-world name in favor of a hacker handle.

## User stories

* As a user, I'd like to visit a page to see a list of all team or club members.
* As a user, I'd like to click a team or club member's entry in the list to visit their profile page, * which should include more details about them.
* As a user, I'd like the option to visit an "About" page that explains what the club is, and what they do.
* As a user, I'd like all data persisted in a database, so it's always there when I need it.
* As a user, I'd like to filter the list of users by their particular role in the group, or some other information/category. (For instance, a club may have a treasurer, president, and/or secretary. A sports team may have a goalie, forward, or striker, a book club may have founders and attendees. You're also welcome to filter by something other than role, if it's more relevant to your project.)
* As an administrator, I want to add new users to the club. (User authentication is not required).
* As an administrator, I want to edit user profiles, in case I make a mistake, or need to update their details.
* As an administrator, need the option to delete a user, in case they leave the club or team.
